I'm Suhaib Irsheidat. I'm studying at JUST. I prefer JUST over other universites in the world. It has the enviroment for innovation and helps students by providing varity of knowledge resources. I'm majoring Computer Science program. I toke very good courses in different fields. Programming, Networks, Hardware and Algorithms. But my favourite course was CS442 Wireless Networks. It was amazing course. Dr. Firas Al-balas gave it to us. CS442 talks about waves and data transmission through the open space. And how data transformed, modulated and transmitted. CS442 showed us what are the faults that can happen. And how to secure data and waves. And what are the security measures that been considered. CS442 gave me a good knowledge in how cellular networks are work. And how phone calls done. At that time I toke CS442, we had to make a presentation about anything related to CS442 subjects. I made my presentation about "How space crafts communicate?". It was incredible. I ganned a knowledge in the physical properties of waves, light, and materials. And how many studies they made to make it happen. CS442 is seriously my favourite course. And I'm planning to enter a MSc degree in networks. I found it an interesting field beacuse of CS442.
